	abstract = {This paper proposes an approach to mitigate epidemic spread in a population of strategic agents by encouraging safer behaviors through carefully designed rewards. These rewards, which vary according to the state of the epidemic, are ascribed by a dynamic payoff mechanism we seek to design. We use a modified SIRS model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the population's agents strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics to model the population's strategic behavior, we extend previous related work so as to allow for noise in the agents' perceptions of the rewards and intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium with minimized infection prevalence, under budget constraints. We use the Lyapunov function to construct anytime upper bounds for the size of the population's infectious fraction. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response models, we propose a method to learn the model's parameter from data.},

	abstract = {We consider a large population of learning agents noncooperatively selecting strategies from a common set, influencing the dynamics of an exogenous system (ES) we seek to stabilize at a desired equilibrium. Our approach is to design a dynamic payoff mechanism capable of shaping the population's strategy profile, thus affecting the ES's state, by offering incentives for specific strategies within budget limits. Employing system-theoretic passivity concepts, we establish conditions under which a payoff mechanism can be systematically constructed to ensure the global asymptotic stabilization of the ES's equilibrium. In comparison to previous approaches originally studied in the context of the so-called epidemic population games, the method proposed here allows for more realistic epidemic models and other types of ES, such as predator-prey dynamics. Stabilization is established with the support of a Lyapunov function, which provides useful bounds on the transients.},
