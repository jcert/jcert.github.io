I am an Electrical Engineering PhD Student at the University of Maryland researching in control theory and evolutionary game theory. With coursework on control, optimization and stochastic processes. Previously worked with embedded systems, electronic design, software development and project budgeting. I have had leadership experience as the president of the EE student association and project manager in the IEEE student branch during my undergrad. Additionally, I served as vice-president for the local hackerspace. Also, I participated in competitions and projects managing teams of up to 5 people.
