Education
======
* Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland - College Park, 2025 (expected)
* B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering, Universidade Estadual de Maringá, 2017

Work experience
======
* 2021-now: Research Assistant - University of Maryland
  * I do research on population games and evolutionary dynamics, both on properties of these frameworks and applications involving strategic interactions of a large number of agents.
  * Advisor: Nuno C. Martins, Co-advisor: Richard J. La
  


*  2018-2019: Embedded Systems Engineer - MKD Tecnologia
   * Developed firmware and hardware for automation projects, mostly using C, working with ARM microcontrollers for low-power devices, ESP32 for Bluetooth communication and older architectures, such as 8051 and PIC16. 
   * I also did PCB layouts, reducing production cost and improving our products. During my time as developer the hardware cost was reduced by more than 20%. I also provided remote support to our technical team and clients.
   * I did field support a few times for our automation producsts (travelling to remote farms!) 
   * In another project, I wrote MikroTik scripts to maintain a hotspot service and configured FreeRadius as AAA, using the routers API through Python scripts to remote update the MikroTiks and monitor them.
   * Configured Linux servers using Docker and developed Ionic companion apps for our embedded projects.
   * Debugged and fixed our costumer's code that interface with our products (WPF C#, SQL, and PostgreSQL).


* 2017-2018: Intern - Universidade Estadual de Maringá
   * As an electrical engineering intern in the Departamentos de Obras e Projetos I have:
        Restructured the IT system of the Electrical Engineering team.
        Took part in construction site inspections, wrote reports and helped project new electrical installations. 
        I also quoted material for the university construction projects and wrote part of the estimated construction cost report.
